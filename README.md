This is a group project developed in high school for the Computer Science Certificate. The project is made in C# programming language and represents an online class book where the student can view his school situation. In the class book, you can add grades, non-attendances to certain subjects, compute the average of grades and in case of an incorrect grade, it can be deleted and re-entered. In addition, each grade, average and non-attendance of the student is stored in a database.
